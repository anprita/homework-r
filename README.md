We created this Rfile so that we can put our all codes together for exploring different plots. We analyze 7 plots to examine the relationship:
Plot 1 &2  : Time series data of sex and number of sample per plot type
Plot 3 : Correlation between length of hindfoot and weight of animal
Plot 4 : Changes of weight over the year based on each plot type
Plot 5 : Changes of length of hindfoot  over the year based on each plot type
Plot 6 : The relationship between hindfoot_length and weight on each plot type
Plot 7 : Comparation between hindfoot length and each plot type
